To enhance machine learning model performance by artificially expanding datasets. It covers augmentation methods for images, text, and tabular data, helping improve generalization and reduce overfitting.



# Data Augmentation Techniques

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates various **data augmentation techniques** to improve machine learning model performance.  

## Overview  
Data augmentation is a technique used to artificially expand the training dataset by applying transformations to the existing data. This helps in reducing overfitting and improving generalization.  

## Key Techniques Covered  
- **Image Augmentation** (Rotation, Flipping, Scaling, Brightness Adjustment, etc.)  
- **Text Augmentation** (Synonym Replacement, Back Translation, Random Insertion, etc.)  
- **Tabular Data Augmentation** (Synthetic Data Generation, SMOTE)  

The notebook provides practical examples and implementations of these augmentation techniques using popular libraries like **TensorFlow, PyTorch, and NLTK**.  

## Usage  
The augmentation techniques showcased in this repository can be applied to **computer vision, NLP, and structured data tasks**, making models more robust and diverse.
